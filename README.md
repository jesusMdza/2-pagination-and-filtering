Project: Pagination and Filtering

Vanilla JS

CSS and HTML were given automatically. A list of students were 
displayed all on one page.

I was required to enhance the user experience by dividing the list
into pages which displayed 10 students for each page.

For extra credit, I created a search bar to filter through
the list and display what the user typed in real time. If a student
was not on the list, an error message appeared.
